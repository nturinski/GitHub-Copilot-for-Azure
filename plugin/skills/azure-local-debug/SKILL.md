# Azure Local Debug

> **AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE — MANDATORY COMPLIANCE**
>
> This document is the **official, canonical source** for setting up local development environments for Azure projects. You **MUST** follow these instructions exactly as written. When in doubt, defer to this document. Do not improvise, infer, or substitute steps.

---

## Triggers

Activate this skill when the user wants to:

- Set up their workspace for local development / debugging
- Configure project for local development / debugging in their IDE
- Add or configure Azure emulators locally (Azurite, Cosmos DB Emulator, Service Bus Emulator, Event Hubs Emulator)
- Generate `docker-compose.yml` for Azure emulator services
- Create or update IDE debug launch configurations
- Generate API local test collection for verifying triggers & endpoints
- Automate database migrations for local development

## Global Rules (NO EXCEPTIONS)

1. **Update plan progressively** — Mark steps complete as you go; update **Last Updated** timestamp on every status change
2. ❌ **Destructive actions require `ask_user`** — Always confirm before overwriting, deleting, or modifying existing files
3. **Preserve existing config** — Never silently overwrite project configuration files or `docker-compose.yml`. Merge or ask first.
4. **Scope — local development only** — This skill configures the developer's machine and existing workspace project for local debugging. Cloud deployment is handled by **azure-prepare** → **azure-validate** → **azure-deploy**.
5. **Warn on limited support** — When a feature is not yet fully implemented (e.g. project type, runtime, emulator, IDE), you MUST emit a `⚠️ LIMITED SUPPORT:` warning — [limited-support.md](references/limited-support.md).

---

## PLAN-FIRST WORKFLOW

> **YOU MUST CREATE A PLAN BEFORE DOING ANY WORK**
>
> 1. **STOP** — Do not generate any configuration files yet
> 2. **CLASSIFY** — Run Phase 0 to detect IDE, project type(s), runtime(s), and dependencies
> 3. **PLAN** — Run Phase 1 to create `.azure/local-development-plan.md`
> 4. **CONFIRM** — Present the plan to the user and get approval
> 5. **EXECUTE** — Only after approval, run Phase 2
>
> ⚠️ **CRITICAL: The `.azure/local-development-plan.md` must be created inside the workspace root** (e.g., `my-project/.azure/local-development-plan.md`), not in a session-state folder.

---

## Phase 0: Classify

Scan the full workspace for service roots. Always produces a list of `services[]` and a workspace-level `ide`. Load the corresponding project-type, runtime, and IDE reference(s) before continuing to Phase 1.

| Action | Reference |
|--------|-----------|
| **IMPORTANT**: Always check for `.azure/project-plan.md` in the workspace root. If found, read it to understand the project's architecture, services, runtimes, and Azure dependencies. Use this context to inform planning in subsequent phases. This file is **optional** — if it does not exist, proceed normally. | `.azure/project-plan.md` (if present) |
| Scan all subdirectories; detect project type + runtime per service root | [classify.md](references/classify.md) |
| If 2+ service roots found: assemble shared workspace context, deduplicate emulators, assign debug ports | [multi-service.md](references/multi-service.md) |

---

## Phase 1: Plan

Create `.azure/local-development-plan.md` by completing these steps **sequentially** — each step builds on the outputs of previous steps. Do NOT generate any artifacts until the plan is approved.

| # | Action | Reference |
|---|--------|-----------|
| 1 | **Inventory Dependencies** — For each service: scan bindings/SDKs, identify emulators needed, check existing config | [inventory.md](references/inventory.md), [project-types/{type}.md](references/project-types/), [runtimes/{rt}.md](references/runtimes/) |
| 2 | **Detect Prerequisites** — Check which required tools are installed and which are missing | [inventory.md](references/inventory.md), [project-types/{type}.md](references/project-types/), [runtimes/{rt}.md](references/runtimes/) |
| 3 | **Detect Migrations** — Scan for database migration files or ORM config; if found, plan a docker-compose migration service | [migrations.md](references/migrations.md) |
| 4 | **Determine Launch Configuration** — Build the debug/launch configuration per service using the detected IDE | [ide/{ide}.md](references/ide/), [project-types/{type}.md](references/project-types/), [runtimes/{rt}.md](references/runtimes/) |
| 5 | **Plan API Test Collection** — List HTTP endpoints and trigger-based functions that need test scripts | [api-test-collections.md](references/api-test-collections.md) |
| 6 | **Limited-Support Warnings** — For every detected project type, runtime, IDE, and emulator: normalize to canonical ID, check for a matching file in the reference folder, and emit a `⚠️ LIMITED SUPPORT:` warning in your assistant message if no match exists. Log warnings in the plan's `## Limited Support` section. Never silently substitute a supported alternative. | [limited-support.md](references/limited-support.md) |
| 7 | **Write Plan** — Generate `.azure/local-development-plan.md` using the template. Prerequisites section must list installed vs. missing with install links. Set **Created** and **Last Updated** to the current UTC datetime (ISO 8601). | [plan-template.md](references/plan-template.md) |
| 8 | **Present Plan** — Show plan to user and ask for approval. If prerequisites are missing, highlight them and ask the user to install before proceeding. Once approved, update plan status to `Approved` and **Last Updated** timestamp. | `.azure/local-development-plan.md` |

---

> **❌ STOP HERE** — Do NOT proceed to Phase 2 until the user approves the plan.

---

## Phase 2: Generate

| # | Action | Reference |
|---|--------|-----------|
| 1 | **Pre-flight** — Verify `.azure/local-development-plan.md` exists with status `Approved`. Set status to `Executing` and update **Last Updated** before writing any files. | `.azure/local-development-plan.md` |
| 2 | **Generate** — The plan drives implementation. Implement faithfully; use best judgment where the plan is underspecified. | [generate.md](references/generate.md) |

## Phase 3: Validate

> ⚠️ **CRITICAL: You MUST complete every validation step below before proceeding. Do NOT mark the task as complete, do NOT set status to `Implemented`, and do NOT deliver a closing message until validation is finished and the checklist is updated with real results.

Validate that the generated IDE configuration works. The validation steps are IDE-specific — refer to the active IDE adapter:

| IDE | Reference |
|-----|-----------|
| VS Code | [ide/vscode.md § Validation](references/ide/vscode.md) |
| Other | [limited-support.md](references/limited-support.md) |

You MUST:
1. Follow **every** validation step in the IDE reference — execute them, do not skip or assume they pass
2. Update the `## Debug Configuration Checklist` section in `.azure/local-development-plan.md` with the real ✅ or ❌ result for **each** configuration
3. Only after **every** checklist stub has been replaced with a real result may you mark status as `Implemented` and proceed

> ⛔ Do NOT set status to `Implemented` until every stub in the Debug Configuration Checklist has been replaced with a real ✅ or ❌ result. A checklist with any remaining stubs is incomplete — go back and validate.

---

## Outputs

| Artifact | Location |
|----------|----------|
| **Plan** | `.azure/local-development-plan.md` |
| Architecture Diagram | `.azure/local-development-plan.md` § Architecture |
| Docker Compose | `docker-compose.yml` |
| IDE Debug Config | IDE-specific — see [ide/{ide}.md](references/ide/) |
| IDE Build Config | IDE-specific — see [ide/{ide}.md](references/ide/) |
| Convenience Scripts | Runtime-specific script runner (see [runtimes/{rt}.md](references/runtimes/)) |
| API Test Collections | `api-test-collections/local-development/<test-name>/invoke.sh` |

---

## Next Steps — MANDATORY CLOSING MESSAGE

After validation, end your response with the following:

| # | Item | What to say |
|---|------|-------------|
| 1 | **Start Debugging** | Tell the user to start debugging using their IDE's debug/run action. Refer to the IDE-specific quick start in [ide/{ide}.md](references/ide/). Example - for VS Code: "Press **F5** and select the compound launch configuration (e.g., 'Start All')." |
| 2 | **Offer API Testing** | Offer to run any API test collection scripts on the user's behalf. Caveat - the user must start the app first; the scripts often target `localhost` endpoints that require the app to be running. |
| 3 | **Azure Cloud Deployment** | Mention that for subsequent Azure cloud deployment, hand off to: `azure-prepare` → `azure-validate` → `azure-deploy`. |

Example closing message (adapt based on detected IDE):

> ## Next Steps
>
> Start the application using your IDE's debug/run action. For VS Code, press **F5** and select **Start All**.
>
> Once the app is running, you can ask me to run the API test collection scripts to verify your endpoints.
>
> When you're ready to deploy to Azure, I can help with that too.
